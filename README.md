# Here is Some Info about Me


Hi! My name is Anna.I have a finance/accounting background. I like working with Adobe Illustrator and have a small portfolio of seamless patterns on [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/").

# And here is why I am taking this course


Before I decided to join the program, I was trying to learn Web Development by taking courses on teamtreehouse.com. 

Here are some highlights about why I like web development:
* I have ability to implement my ideas
* I can see the result immediatly
* It can be challanging, but I like feeling I get after I solved some interesting problem


I am taking this course, because I want to learn more coding and improve my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and my goal is to become an employed web developer.


Here is a picture of me and my friends
